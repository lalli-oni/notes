Markdown files used to organize anything I (Larus Thor/lalli-oni) can think of.

## Runespeakers
Even though this is a personal endeavor, I would be a hypocritical existentialist(-ish) if it were purely tied to my identity. As such I envisioned `runespeakers` as an organization. I have no delusions about enlisting help from others, peoples time is valuable and I prefer people wouldn't waste it on anything I'm working here. But one can dream that this organization gets to the level of maturity where contributions would be creating value. 

The philosophy is to be an opinionated, value driven coalition of developers and others who share relatively similar values and will to create and receive value. Throwing out some buzzwords to establish a rough image of core tenants: `democratic`, `borderless`, `DEI`, `value driven`, `de-centralized`, `not for profit`, `dynamic`, (...`pretentious`, `delusional`, `naive`, `silly`)

## Tasks
1. [TODO] Figure out if this is a good platform to handle tasks management
2. [TODO] Figure out whether/how to integrate it my trello
3. [TODO] Look into the obsidian native tasks
## Growing garden
I have this personal "digital garden" which was intended to at least publish my notes. Right now the notes simply exist as `.md` files inside that repo. It only has 2 types of files.
-  `articles` which are both meant for me personally and to share publicly
-  `experiments` which are hybrid text content and web applications
It is written using SvelteKit and hosted using vercel.
1.  [TODO] Import growing garden content to here
2. [TODO] Investigate whether we can use our synched public GitHub repo to build the content for the Growing Garden (or pull the content on runtime?)
3. [TODO] Represent this obsidian solution in the Growing Garden.
4. [TODO] Really "Growing Garden"? Shitty name IMHPO, I wanted to represent it's at least losely based on the digital garden concept and that it's very much a WIP
5. [TODO] If we are to use the GitHub synched repo as a data source, we need to consider the synching process. I was already using the markdown metadata to control which articles are published, but should the growing garden be updated on synching? And if so, how to secure unintended synching?
## Integrations
GitHub syncing plugin. Syncs between local files and [https://github.com/lalli-oni/notes](lalli-oni/notes) public repo.
## Patterns
Extensive use of tables. Use tags to connect entries between files.
1. [TODO] Find a structure that lends itself to relatively self contained concepts while promoting "views" across different dimensions. Fx. [[Generic Frontend]] has plenty of "misc." entries that spans other concepts
## Templates
```dataview
LIST
FROM "Markdown templates"
```
